This project builds a geospatial analysis tool that measures accessibility to healthy urban planning services in France by computing isochrones with OpenRouteService and merging them with local demographic data. The resulting web application highlights gaps in urban infrastructure and enables stakeholders to understand how well local amenities meet public health needs. The project was conducted as part of the "Policy-in-Action" module of the École Polytechnique-ENSAE Master's program in "Data and Economics for Public Policy". It was done for ECOLAB at the Ministère de la transition écologique. Students : Salma El Aazdoudi, Robert Campbell Powers, Mona Bennis and Sofia Vaca.
