# Review of Accessibility Scores Measures

To build our own accessibility score, we began by reviewing established scoring systems used in health-oriented urban planning, as well as the methodologies commonly applied to measure accessibility. To begin with, one straightforward method is the cumulative opportunities measure, which counts the number of healthcare facilities reachable within a predefined time or distance threshold (Zhao, Li, & Liu, 2020). A key limitation of this model is that it ignores supply-side limitations, which is problematic in contexts where service capacity has a central role, such as in the case of healthcare services. 

Another more complex method that addresses this limitation are potential accessibility measures, also known as gravity-based measures. As highlighted by Wang (2012), these models consider the interaction between supply and demand in different locations and have been used in health care access and also job access. Specifically these models estimate how accessible opportunities (such as hospitals) are from a given origin zone i, by taking into account the presence of opportunities in all other zones n (Geurs & van Wee, 2004). The key idea is that closer and larger facilities contribute more to the overall accessibility score, while smaller or more distant facilities have a diminishing effect. This reduction in influence is modeled using a distance-decay function, which mathematically decreases the weight of each facility based on how far or difficult it is to reach. A limitation of this model is its intuition for public health professionals and that the model is sensitive to assumptions and to how the distance friction parameter is defined, which requires additional data and can be very context specific (Wang, 2012).

The Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method, developed by Luo and Wang (2003), is a widely used approach to measure spatial accessibility. It has been widely used in evaluation of accessibility in public service facilities such as healthcare services, schools, elderly care facilities and green spaces. It operates in two sequential steps. Taking healthcare facilities as an example, in the first step, for each healthcare provider location, a catchment area is defined based on a threshold travel time (e.g., 30 minutes). Within this area, the physician-to-population ratio is calculated by dividing the supply (number of physicians) by the total population residing within the catchment. In the second step, for each population location, all provider locations within the same travel time threshold are identified, and their physician-to-population ratios are summed to produce an accessibility score for that population point. While intuitive and easy to implement using GIS tools, a limitation of it is that it assumes equal accessibility within the catchment and none outside, which oversimplifies real-world spatial interactions (Wang, 2012). 

Many scholars have proposed improvements for the accuracy and flexibility of this method. Zhao et al. (2022) group these improvements into four main categories. First, spatial decay weights have been introduced to better reflect the decreasing likelihood of patients traveling longer distances for care. For instance, the Enhanced 2SFCA (E2SFCA), developed by Luo and Qi (as cited in Zhao et al., 2022), divides travel time into intervals and assigns different weights to each, while other researchers have applied continuous decay functions such as kernel density or Gaussian functions. 

Second, the search radius can be adjusted dynamically based on contextual factors like population density or facility level. Third, competition between facilities has been incorporated to show how the demand at one provider may be influenced by near alternatives. For example, combining the Huff model with 2SFCA introduces choice weights to simulate individual facility preferences (Zhao et al., 2022). Fourth, Langford (as cited in Zhao et al., 2022) proposed differentiating travel time thresholds based on transportation modes, allowing more realistic modeling of supply-demand relationships.

Finally, it is clear that improvements to the 2SFCA method vary depending on the specific goals and context of each study. For instance, Zhao et al. (2022) developed an improved version to assess accessibility to elderly care facilities. Their model introduces two key refinements: it uses the actual road network to calculate the shortest travel paths instead of Euclidean distances, and it adjusts the catchment radius based on the mobility characteristics of the elderly, setting an 800-meter walking threshold. Additionally, a probability function is included to account for user choice, incorporating facility capacity and service quality. These modifications allow for a more realistic and context-sensitive analysis of accessibility, particularly for vulnerable populations.
